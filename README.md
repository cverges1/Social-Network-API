  ## Description
  This project is the backend of a Social Network API using MongoDB and mongoose. Users are able to add and delete friends, post and update their thoughts, and react to other user's thoughts. My motivation in creating the Social Network API was to experiment with a nosql database and to discover the strenghts and weaknesses between the two.  Working on this project taught me the basics of MongoDB and mongoose and allowed me to practice common issues that may arise with a nosql database. I learned that using nosql, creating routes and models was much easier but catching an error can be more difficult as you might not get as detailed of a message or any message at all.

  ## Usage
  
  In the terminal at the root file run `npm start` to start the server. There is no front-end for this project so you will need to use a program such as insomnia in order to use the routes to create and delete users, create, delete and update thoughts, and create and delete reactions.
